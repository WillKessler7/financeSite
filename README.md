# financeSite
This is my Honors Computer Science final django project. I have made a finance site that gets data from an API to nicely display their financial information to them.

3 Extra things to look for and a fourth bonus thing:

I was able to utilize the vastness of python libraries by using the yfinance API to get stock data in real time
* FOR YFINANCE API YOU MAY NEED TO USE PIP TO INSTALL THE LIBRARY TO RUN IT PROPERLY *

I also used semantic UI which is a user interface development library designed to intergrate into bootstrap/html and this made my website look very nice and professional.

I was able to code my program to perform more complex calculations from the number of shares the user inputed and the stock price gotten through the API. Some of these
calculations included the total value of one stock a user owned and the total value of the user's portfolio.

Bonus: I made a button that created a user locally by registering through a form
